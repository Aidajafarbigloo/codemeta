## Minimal metadata for code: a crosswalk

At the [Open Science Codefest](http://nceas.github.io/open-science-codefest/), we met to discuss the metadata for scientific software. Participants included:

- Abigail Cabunoc / @abbycabs
- Matt Jones / @metamattj
- Carly Strasser / @carlystrasser
- Corinna Gries / @CorinnaGries

Work was recorded on [this etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/oscodefest-softwaremetadata).

The discussion centered around metadata for software to enable software discovery, software reuse and interpretation, and software citation. A number of existing software metadata efforts exist and have been in use for varying lengths of time.  We have created a crosswalk that shows the field correspondences between these:

- [CodeMeta](https://github.com/mbjones/codemeta/)
- [code.jsonld](http://www.arfon.org/json-ld-for-software-discovery-reuse-and-credit)
- Figshare
- Zenodo
- [NIH Software Discovery report](http://softwarediscoveryindex.org/report/)

Additional software metadata standards that have not yet been cross-walked:
- [Software Ontology (SWO)](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/5/1/25)
- [eml-software](http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/sofwtare/eml)
- [EBM Tools database](http://www.ebmtools.org/)
- [DataONE Software registry](https://www.dataone.org/software-tools)
- [Winning model documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/WinningModelDocumentationTemplate)
- [MyExperiment workflow repository](http://www.myexperiment.org/)
- [Description of a Project (DOAP)](https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki)
- Language/System specific package frameworks
    - Debian packages
    - CRAN R packages
    - RPM packages
    - ...

The crosswalk table has been moved to [crosswalk.csv](./crosswalk.csv)

- Other things to add:
    -  Annotations
        - attribute selected fields to someone
    	- Zenodo, Figshare allow users to comment
